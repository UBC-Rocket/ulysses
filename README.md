# Ulysses

**Open-source flight controller firmware for UBC Rocket's experimental VTOL platform**

Ulysses powers UBC Rocket's Coaxial Counter-Rotating Vertical Take-off and Landing Drone — a testbed designed for developing and validating advanced rocket flight control algorithms in real-world conditions.

The project is a multi-phase plan, with the goal of a fully-featured prototype capable of returning to a specified point when dropped at a high altitude by 2027. The goal for the 2025 - 2026 academic year is as follows: 

| Phase | Deliverables | Planned Completion |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Prototype capable of moving up, hovering, and landing | Jan 2026 |
| Phase 2 | Prototype capable of moving along a horizontal plane | May 2026 |
| Phase 3 | Swapping from a PID-based control system to an MPC system; FPGA system; general polishing | LC 2025 |
